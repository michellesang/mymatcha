## hi, welcome to mymatcha! 🍵

as a matcha connoisseur who has tried countless varieties of matcha, 
i wanted a place to keep track of my favorite matcha products. 
i decided to build it myself and practice my 
web design and development skills along the way!


i created this web app for matcha lovers, designed for minimalism and practicality. 
it includes a UI build with React and Tailwind CSS, and an API built with FastAPI.
